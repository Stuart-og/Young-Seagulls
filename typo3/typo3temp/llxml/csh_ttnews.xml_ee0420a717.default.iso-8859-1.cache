If the current record is a translation (if it has a translation original and a non-default syslanguage) the categories are not editable, they will only be listed in the tt_news form.

Categories can have parent categories. F.e the category FrontEnd plugins in the screenshot below does have category Extensions selected as parent category, so FrontEnd plugins is a subcategory of Extensions. That has the result, that the record in this example which has category FrontEnd plugins will also appear in a list that shows only category Extensions.

The titles of the assigned categories will substite the html-template marker ###NEWS_CATEGORY###, the category images will be written to the marker ###NEWS_CATEGORY_IMAGE###.

strongNote:/strong
The use of subcategories has to be enabled in the TypoScript setup:
em
plugin.tt_news.useSubCategories = 1/em

strongControlling editing permissions with assigned categories:/strong
It's possible to control the editing permissions of news records with the assigned categories. If this feature is enabled a BE user can only change news records that have categories assigned that are defined in the list of allowed categories for this BE-user. If a BE-user performs any action (move,delete,hide,localize,copy,version,modify) with a record that has non-allowed categories assigned an error message will be displayed and the action will be ignored. Another message will be displayed in the news record above the fields Title and Category. Non-selectable categories will be displayed in grey text and not linked. See second screenshot below.

The size of both fields for the category selection can be configured in the extension manager.
